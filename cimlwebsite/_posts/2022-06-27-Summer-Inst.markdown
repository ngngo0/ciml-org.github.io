<h3>SDSC's Cyberinfrastructure-Enabled Machine Learning Summer Institute</h3>
<p>
The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Cyberinfrastructure-Enabled Machine Learning (CIML) project is focused on teaching researchers and students the best-known practices for effectively running machine learning (ML) and data science applications on advanced cyberinfrastructure and high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
</p>
<p>
This year’s CIML Summer Institute will involve introducing ML researchers, developers and educators to the techniques and methods needed to migrate their ML applications from smaller, locally run resources, such as laptops and workstations, to large-scale HPC systems, such as the SDSC Expanse supercomputer. Participants will have the opportunity to accelerate their learning process through highly interactive classes with hands-on tutorials on SDSC’s Expanse.
</p>
<p>

Although the institute will focus on 3 scientific domains (cardiology, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics), participants from all fields are welcome.
